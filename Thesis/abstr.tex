Runtime Verification is a technique to extract information from a running 
system in order to detect executions violating a given correctness 
specification. In this thesis, we study distributed synchronous/asynchronous 
runtime verification of systems. In our setting, there is a set of distributed 
monitors that have only partial views of a large system and are subject to 
failures. In this context, it is unavoidable that monitors may have different 
views of the underlying system, and therefore may have different valuations of 
the correctness property. In this thesis, we propose an automata-based 
synchronous monitoring algorithm that copes with $f$ crash failures in a 
distrbuted setting. The algorithm solves the synchronous monitoring problem in 
$f+1$ rounds of communication, and significantly reduces the message size 
overhead. We also propose an algorithm for distributed crash-resilient 
asynchronous monitoring that consistently monitors the system under inspection 
without any communication between monitors. Each local monitor emits a verdict 
set solely based on its own partial observation, and the intersection of the 
verdict sets will be the same as the verdict computed by a centralized monitor 
that has full view of the system.
