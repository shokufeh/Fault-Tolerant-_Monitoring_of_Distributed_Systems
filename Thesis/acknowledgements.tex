Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Borzoo Bonakdarpour for the continuous support of my M.Sc. study and research, for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. I could not have imagined having a better mentor for my M.Sc. study.
I am very grateful to Professor Ryszard Janicki and Professor Mark Lawford for graciously agreeing to be my examiners and for their invaluable comments and suggestions. I am also grateful for the funding and support provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).
Finally, I would like to thank my loved ones, who have supported me and encouraged me  throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis.
